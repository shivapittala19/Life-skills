### 2. How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier? What are M, A and P.

BJ Fogg's formula for behavior: Behavior = Motivation + Ability + Prompt. To establish a new habit, your motivation, ability, and prompt must align

*  Start with the tiniest version of a habit to require minimal motivation.
*  Use action prompts, where one behavior triggers the next, to build momentum for your tiny habits.Find a behavior that takes 30 seconds or less to complete.
*  Nurture your tiny habit with "shine," which is the feeling of accomplishment, to help it grow into a more significant habit.
*  Celebrate even tiny wins to boost your confidence and motivation, making habit development easier.

###  3.Why it is important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of habit? (This is the most important concept in today's topic. Whatever you celebrate becomes a habit)

Celebrating or "shining" after each successful completion of a habit is important for several reasons:

* It helps build momentum by reinforcing progress and encouraging further action.
* It provides positive feedback that serves as a reward, which can be powerful incentive to continue forming good habits.
* It provides feedback that helps identify patterns in behavior so you can adjust your strategy accordingly.
* It increases satisfaction because it feels good to achieve small goals.
* It makes future success more achievable since you've already achieved something tangible.
* It allows you to learn from past failures and improve upon them.
* Celebrations provide a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction, which can boost your motivation to continue the habit
* Celebrating milestones helps you track and recognize your progress.
* Boosts self-esteem and confidence


#### 4. In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?

* Small daily improvements compound over time, making good habits and choices vital for long-term success.
* Start with a habit by making it easy to begin, as starting is often the most challenging part of a habit.
* Creating specific implementation intentions, with a clear plan for when, where, and how to execute a habit, increases the likelihood of success.

#### 5. What is the book's perspective about Identity?

The book's perspective on identity can be summarized as follows:

* Identity Change is Key: According to the book, changing habits is not just about setting goals or focusing on outcomes. Instead, it's about transforming your identity. The ultimate form of intrinsic motivation occurs when a habit becomes part of your identity.
* Shifting from Outcome to Identity: The book encourages a shift from thinking about outcomes and results to starting with your identity. To create lasting change, you should view yourself as the type of person who naturally engages in the desired habit.
* Long-Term Habit Transformation: When you work on changing your identity and embracing new habits as part of who you are, you are more likely to achieve long-term success. Temporary solutions based solely on outcomes are less effective.

#### 6.Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit easier to do?

* **Reduce Friction:** Clear emphasizes that friction is a significant barrier to habit formation. To make a habit easier to do, you should reduce the effort required to perform it. This can be achieved by simplifying the steps involved and minimizing any obstacles in your way.

* **Prime Your Environment:** The book advocates for shaping your environment to encourage the habit you want to build. For example, if you want to eat healthier, make healthy foods more visible and accessible in your kitchen while keeping unhealthy snacks hidden. This primes your environment for success.

* **Use Cues and Triggers:** Creating clear cues or triggers can make a habit more accessible. For instance, if you want to read more, place a book on your nightstand to serve as a cue before bedtime. The more visible and obvious the cue, the easier it becomes to initiate the habit.

* **Make It Immediately Satisfying:** Immediate rewards can make a habit more attractive and easier to stick with. By associating a habit with a small, immediate reward, you can make the habit more appealing. For example, rewarding yourself with a favorite treat after a workout makes the habit of exercising more enjoyable.

* **Create a Habit Routine:** Establishing a specific routine or schedule can also make a habit easier to do. When a habit becomes part of your daily routine, it requires less conscious effort and decision-making

#### 7.Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit harder to do?

* **Increase Friction:** To make a habit harder to do, the book suggests increasing the level of friction associated with that habit. This means adding obstacles or making the steps involved more cumbersome. For example, if you want to reduce the time spent on social media, you can log out of your accounts each time you finish using them. This extra step adds friction and makes the habit less convenient.
* **Remove Temptations:** Clear recommends removing temptations or cues that trigger the undesired habit. If you're trying to cut down on snacking, keep unhealthy snacks out of your sight or reach. This eliminates the visual cues that encourage the habit.
* **Reposition Cues:** If possible, change the location or context of cues associated with the habit you want to avoid. For instance, if you're trying to spend less time watching television, move the remote control to a less accessible spot. This makes the cue less prominent in your environment.
* **Create Negative Consequences:** Introducing negative consequences for engaging in the habit can make it harder to continue. For example, you might establish a rule that if you fail to complete a productive task, you must donate to a charity you dislike. This creates a disincentive for the habit.
* **Surround Yourself with Accountability:** Share your goals and progress with others who can hold you accountable. By making your habits public or involving friends and family in your efforts, you increase the social consequences of not sticking to your intentions.

### 8. Pick one habit that you would like to do more of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue obvious or the habit more attractive or easy and or response satisfying?

Steps I can take to make this habit more appealing and easier:
* Set a specific time and place for meditation.
* Start with a short duration, such as 5-10 minutes, and gradually increase the time 
* Use guided meditation apps or listen to calming meditation music
* After each meditation, take a moment to reflect on how you feel more relaxed, focused, and centered.

### 9. Pick one habit that you would like to eliminate or do less of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue invisible or the process unattractive or hard or the response unsatisfying?

One habit I'd like to eliminate is to play video games.

* It is impossible not to play suddenly.
* Limit the screentime for those and gradually reduce the screen time.
